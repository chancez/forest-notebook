    "Welcome to your QMI! Your Quantum Machine Image is a virtual development and execution environment for quantum programming. It is hosted in close physical proximity to the QPUs in Rigettiâ€™s quantum data center. This integrated platform eliminates the network latency found in web API access models, allowing you to iterate faster. It comes with a pre-configured Jupyter server that is a great way to get started writing quantum programs, and running them on the QVM and the QPU. Don't forget to also try connecting to your QMI via `ssh` (Secure Shell), and moving files to and from your QMI using Secure Copy (`scp`). For more information on this, check out our [documentation](https://www.rigetti.com/qcs/docs/getting-started-with-your-qmi#qmi).\n",

    "In this beginner's example, we are going to run a simple `hello_qmi()`. This function composes a simple quantum program, compiles it, and then runs it on the target device of your choice: either the QVM or a QPU. It is located in the `hello_qmi.py` file located in the home folder of your QMI at `/home/forest/hello_qmi.py`. You can browse to this file directly in Jupyter, or find it by `ssh`ing into your QMI."
